    "body": "Currently there is no enforced relationship between the URL used to look up resources in the package, and where the resource came from online.  Consistent URLs are an imperfect, but extremely useful signal for privacy protecting tools (filter lists, adblockers, disconnect, Firefox and Edge built in protections, safe browsing, etc.).  \r\n\r\nThe current proposal would allow for all WebPackage'd sites to circumvent all URL based tools by simply randomizing URLs as a post processing step in [amppackager](https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager) or similar.  This could even be done per-request per page.  Since URLs are effectively just indexes into the package (and not keys for decision making, caching, etc), they can be changed arbitrarily w/o affecting how the package loads, but preventing the URL-based privacy preserving tools from running.\r\n\r\nA (partial) possible solution to the problem is to play a [cut-and-choose](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/zhu), commitment-auditing style games with the URLs.  At package time, the packager has to make commitments about which URL each resource came from, and the size, shape etc of the resource.  These can be made / mixed with the URL of the page being packaged. \r\n\r\nThe client can then, w/ some probability, audit some number of the URLs in the package.  If the commitments fail, deterring counter measures can be taken against the packing origin (e.g. global decaying block list of misbehaving packagers, etc)."

[-1], encoded as 81 20.\r\n8. false, encoded as F4.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, section 3.9 of [RFC 7049](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7049.txt) states:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   o  The keys in every map must be sorted lowest value to highest.\r\n      Sorting is performed on the bytes of the representation of the key\r\n      data items without paying attention to the 3/5 bit splitting for\r\n      major types.  (Note that this rule allows maps that have keys of\r\n      different types, even though that is probably a bad practice that\r\n      could lead to errors in some canonicalization implementations.)\r\n      The sorting rules are:\r\n\r\n      *  If two keys have different lengths, the shorter one sorts\r\n         earlier;\r\n\r\n      *  If two keys have the same length, the one with the lower value\r\n         in (byte-wise) lexical order sorts earlier.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a little odd, but this reads to me as if keys should be sorted by key length first, and only then should keys with the same length be lexically sorted. This would give the sorting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. 10, encoded as 0A.\r\n2. -1, encoded as 20.\r\n3. false, encoded as F4.\r\n4. 100, encoded as 18 64.\r\n5. \"z\", encoded as 61 7A.\r\n6. [-1], encoded as 81 20.\r\n7. \"aa\", encoded as 62 61 61.\r\n8. [100], encoded as 81 18 64.\r\n```"

    "body": "@MattMenke2 pointed out that if a server can get a large number of unique packages generated for two different origins (either by having signing keys for both origins or by getting those origins to cooperate), it can build a bundle that will transfer a user ID between those two origins, given our current idea of how bundle loading will work. That is:\r\n\r\n1. When client C fetches `https://evil.example/the_bundle`, evil.example puts signed HTML files from the two origins into the bundle, each embedding a unique ID. (If the IDs are different, evil.example just records that they refer to the same user.) At this point, https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/master/explainers/anti-tracking.md says evil.example doesn't have access to its own user ID, but this doesn't save us.\r\n1. C redirects to `origin1.example/index.html`, which has access to both `origin1.example`'s online storage and the embedded unique ID, so it reports that `origin1.example`'s user ID is associated with the unique ID.\r\n1. The user now navigates C to `origin2.example/index.html`. Our current notion of how bundles should work says that this doesn't go back to the network, since the user has already downloaded the content and shouldn't need to fetch it again. However, at this point, the new page has access to both `origin2.example`'s online storage and the embedded unique ID, so it reports that association, and learns that origin2's user ID is associated with origin 1's user ID.∎\r\n\r\nThe simplest fix is to [remove](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/#drop-feature) the ability to include multiple signed top-level origins in the same bundle. Or, similarly, declare that the top-level origin of the entire bundle is the one identified in its start URL, so no other origins within the bundle can access their online storage.\r\n\r\nA requirement that signatures are X minutes old, as suggested in #422, doesn't help here, since evil.example can just stockpile unique IDs for that long.\r\n\r\nIf we can find a way to identify the a large number of different resources are available at the same URL, we could use that mechanism to re-allow multiple top-level resources."

Although [this is mainly for enabling HTTP caching](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2560#appendix-A.1.1) and `certurl.FetchOCSPResponse` doesn't cache any response, it's worth supporting as `certurl.CreateOCSPRequest` is also exported.\r\n\r\nIn order to add a test which checks the \"POST\" side of the function, we need data of `len(\"http://<responder>/<encoded OCSP req>\") > 255`. I though like creating a dummy cert whose responder url is super long was the easiest (as I wrote in the test tentatively), I don't know where the existing `test-cert.pem` came from, which has a responder url \"http://ocsp.digicert.com\" and doesn't look like a \"dummy\". Would appreciate some guidance."

    "body": "It's great to see the initial bundle replay implementation in Chrome 80!\r\n\r\nI wanted to suggest an archival use case, from perspective of individual users.\r\nI think web bundles could provide alternative to the existing 'Save Page As...' functionality, which is essentially broken for many modern websites. The idea would be to allow users to 'save' a page as a bundle, and replay the page as best as possible. \r\n\r\nThe goal would be to make this work without requiring sites having to become more bundle-friendly or require signing.\r\n\r\nFor bundles to work as a 'generic' save page alternative, I think two extensions would be really useful:\r\n\r\n- Support for non-GET requests, because many sites use other methods during normal operation. I see that this has been closed in #70. Unfortunately, many sites currently use\r\nPOST in normal operation. An example: Twitter uses POST during normal operation. If a user were to save a Tweet, then a critical POST request would be missed, and shows up as an error.\r\n\r\n- Support for custom request/response resolution, perhaps via a 'bundle scoped service worker' that could override fetch() and handle domain-specific requests. Replaying of network traffic is necessarily non-deterministic as often timestamps are added, so a request for `https://example.com/?_=123` might be replayed as `https://example.com/?_124`. If there was a way for a 'worker' in a site to handle fetch(), it could then resolve these in a bundle-specific way.\r\n\r\nA bit more background: I've been working on a project called Webrecorder, which allows users to capture network traffic and replay it back (though a server proxy). In a way, it is designed to be as close as possible to a working 'save page as...'. This implementation uses a backend server.\r\n\r\nI've also have a service-worker based prototype, https://wab.ac/ which allows replay of HAR, WARC and now bundle WBN files in any browser that supports service workers.\r\nIt uses the 'wayback-machine style' URL rewriting approach, but of course it would be better if it could be done 'natively' in the browser, and bundles provide an exciting possibility for that.\r\n\r\nI've wondering if there is any interest, perhaps down the road, in expanding bundles to be able to support features needed to 'fix' Save Page As... for users? Or expanding the bundle spec so that extensions could be implemented to facilitate better replay of 'saved' pages?"

I'm providing all my uncertainties, hoping that what I'm asking for will be clearer.  Hopefully this isn't totally irrelevant :-)\r\n\r\nLet's say two different [packages](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/issues/411) may depend on possibly different versions of a common JS module (or is that never going to happen?).  It's great that ES Modules can (normally) be able to work with different versions at the same time, due to scope isolation, and not contend with \"dll hell\" type issues.  Packaging should honor that by default, erring on the side of caution.\r\n\r\nBut what about if the two packages aren't that particular about what version they can use (think specifying version ranges in npm dependencies)?  I'm assuming that packages wouldn't be able to figure that out on the fly.  So I would guess an ideal option might be manually creating a third package that contains the common dependencies.  In an ideal world, that all seems fine (I guess), no issues there.  And I'm also quite fine with the concept that we don't always live in an ideal world, and there will be scenarios where applications **download** multiple packages containing some redundancies.\r\n\r\nBut **downloading** is one thing.  **Loading** redundant modules into memory is also something that would be good to minimize where possible.  And there's one scenario where it's vital, and that has to do with using ES6 Symbols cross-package. \r\n\r\nI raised the issue in the [import maps proposal](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/132), thinking the issue would applicable there, but it isn't.  I just wanted to basically raise the same issue here, in case it is relevant here.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't understanding the packaging proposal enough to propose anything concrete, but basically in the case of ES6 Symbols, I want to *require* only loading that module once, regardless of which one downloads first, but more generally, be able to specify ranges of acceptable versions, and reuse which one is loaded into memory first.

Typical one could be passing `0x5BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, a header saying \"I am a byte string of length 2^64 - 1\", without actual data followed.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation allocates memory for following bytes exactly as the header requested:\r\nhttps://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/ce24b25d587c891a45aa6602fef2ded1854d45fa/go/signedexchange/cbor/decoder.go#L93-L98\r\n\r\nFor instance, Chromium checks the size of rest bytes beforehand to defend against this:\r\nhttps://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/6efa1184771ace08f3e2162b0255c93526d1750d/components/cbor/reader.cc#L352-L355\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm not familiar with golang so if there is any better solution, please go that way.\r\n\r\nGolang's `io.Reader` seems a sort of \"stream\" interface therefore the same solution cannot be applicable.\r\nAlternatives could be\r\n- Stop using `io.Reader`\r\n- Read byte by byte into growing buffer\r\n- Try to read by doubling the size (read 1 byte, 2 byte, 4byte, 8 byte...)\r\n(The last two are almost same in terms of amortized complexity trick but the latter can be faster if the read operation costs)\r\n\r\nCurrent choice is to use `bytes.Buffer`, which is, to my understanding, a wrapped growing byte vector which can behave as `io.Writer`. That's because changing to this is super-easy and doesn't cost computation time a lot, very similar to the second solution above.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Bundled Exchanges spec [defines the format of signature section](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html#signatures-section) but doesn't define how to validate it.\r\n\r\nI can imagine how validation works; To validate `(authority, sig, signed)` triple in `vouched-subsets`, a client would run an algorithm similar to the [SXG's Signature validity](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html#signature-validity) but its entities replaced as follows:\r\n\r\n- `requestUrl` -> `signed.subset-hashes` which includes `whatwg-url`\r\n- `responseHeaders` -> `signed.subset-hashes` which includes `header-sha256`\r\n- `payload` -> `payload` in the responses section\r\n- `signature` -> `sig`\r\n- `integrity` -> `payload-integrity-header` included in `signed.subset-hashes`\r\n- `validity-url` -> `signed.validity-url`\r\n- `cert-sha256` -> `signed.auth-sha256`\r\n- `date` -> `signed.date`\r\n- `expires` -> `signed.expires`\r\n- `certificate-chain` -> `authorities`\r\n- `main-certificate` -> `authorities[authority]`\r\n\r\nDoes this align with your idea? @jyasskin\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n- Will signing message be the `signed` binary string itself? It doesn't have the 64-spaces padding nor a context string.\r\n- What's the content of resource at `validity-url`?\r\n- Do the requirements of SXG headers (e.g. no uncached fields) apply to BXG too? Response headers are not included in bundle's metadata, so it'd have to be checked in a later step of loading (it wouldn't be a big deal though).\r\n- What about the certificate requirements?\r\n- Is it possible to unify the algorithm to SXG's validation algorithm? It would make implementation simpler.\r\n"

Since the web is big, it's hard to be confident that we're not going to break anything by making that change.\r\n\r\nSo, we should try to make a complete list of how the web tries to be secure, describe how those attempts rely on transport security, and describe how that's affected by a switch to object security."

We’ll be able to publish another revision at the beginning of the IETF week.\r\n\r\nThis update includes:\r\n\r\n* An invariant fallback URL, like signed exchanges have.\r\n* A version number, so we can easily know to fall back to a redirect.\r\n* Some infrastructure to identify what kind of error broke the parse, which can feed into both Network Error Logging and #397’s discussion of when to fall back.\r\n* The [index](https://jyasskin.github.io/webpackage/update-bundle-format/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html#index-section) maps URLs to a Variants value + a list of the responses for each possible Variant-Key.\r\n* A new [signatures](https://jyasskin.github.io/webpackage/update-bundle-format/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html#signatures-section) section allows authorities to vouch for particular subsets of the bundle. For cross-origin trust, which I think will get defined in the loading spec, I think the requirement that the validity-url is same-origin is going to force us to make those single-origin subsets, even when there might be a certificate that is trusted to sign multiple origins. I’ve run the basic structure by @sleevi who liked that the signed fields are all together in a byte string.\r\n"

However:\r\n\r\n1. A signed exchange can have multiple signatures with different signing times. The most important one is the one that establishes cross-origin trust, but libraries might want to be able to see other signatures.\r\n1. We also want to be able to see the signing time for members of bundles, which might work better as a field in the [`Response`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response), and then we might refer to the Response or the relevant fields from any Document [initialised from it](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#initialise-the-document-object)...\r\n1. This might be a concept we should expose for other cached things, in which case the place we expose it should make sense for non-packaged things.

However, if I'm understanding this right, webbundle parsers *today* need to correctly handle it. Otherwise, critical sections defined in the future won't work properly. Should section 3.3 include it?\r\n\r\nRelatedly, given how critical (hah) it is, maybe it makes sense to put it in section-lengths, and have it be 3-tuples of name, length, boolean. That saves parsers an extra seek and read."

    "body": "The [`Signature` header](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/7aef9b9bd97ab3ea432f4cec22cc7020267f7c29/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.md#the-signature-header--signature-header) makes use of Structured Headers to encapsulate a number of parameters.\r\n\r\nHowever, the structural layout of the specification makes it difficult to easily determine what parameters are signed and unsigned. Through a careful reading, it would appear that only `cert-url` is unsigned.\r\n\r\nThis came up when trying to evaluate the proposal in #397 to understand the assurance level of different fields, at different points within the algorithm. For example, the current algorithm for [validating a signature](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/7aef9b9bd97ab3ea432f4cec22cc7020267f7c29/loading.bs#L775) would appear to be making use of a signed field before the signature has actually been verified.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts come to mind to help simplify this:\r\n- In the discussion of the parameters that participate in the signature, clearly indicate whether each parameter is covered by the 'sig' or not.\r\n- In the discussion of validation algorithms, either\r\n  1. Ensure that signature validation is consistently performed before any accesses to unvalidated data\r\n  1. Use descriptive labels to indicate the level of assurance that each field as. For example, `unverified-validityUrl` becomes `signed-validityUrl` after the signature has been checked, while `integrity` becomes `unverified-integrity`, transitions to `signed-integrity` after signature validation, and becomes `verified-integrity` after the (certificate and revocation) checks.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to try to encapsulate, in the spec, the state machine that each of these variables goes through, so that it's clear whether we're operating on 'untrusted' (not yet signature checked / certificate checked) data or after. While an implementation may simply use the same variable throughout the implementation, the annotations help highlight the assurance. This also helps for future spec changes, because any reordering of sequences would cascade into re-evaluating the labels for any variables.\r\n\r\nOr this might all be a terrible idea, but it was definitely hard to read and reason about the algorithm without knowing clearly whether the variables were signed and when/if they'd been validated."

    "body": "It's been widely discussed that SXG certificates enable off-path attacks. This means that an attacker that has stolen an SXG private key and created SXG content can send it to a client from any server controlled by that attacker, such as a phishing site, and the browser will trust it. This opens up a lot of possibilities for impersonation that are not currently available to an attacker that compromises a TLS certificate. An attacker with a TLS certificate needs to somehow get a client that is already connecting to a site (via DNS and TCP/IP) to connect to a server under their control to fetch the content. This usually requires DNS poisoning or being on-path between the victim and the server.\r\n\r\nBecause SXG introduces a new off-path vector of attack, it's worth considering ways to mitigate this attack vector in the specification. This is the situation we found ourselves in for the Secondary Certificates project (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bishop-httpbis-http2-additional-certs-05), which allows attackers with specially-issued secondary certificates to serve content from multiple sites over the same connection, which enables similar off-path attacks.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation that was discussed in Secondary Certificates to prevent arbitrary off-path domain hijacking was a simple one: we proposed that for a certificate to be used as secondary, it needs an additional field called \"Required Domain\". In order to accept a certificate with a \"Required Domain\" extension, the server must have previously served a certificate that covers the required domain on the same connection. This has the nice property that if a secondary certificate is compromised, it can only be used to hijack traffic if they also have control over the secondary domain.\r\n\r\nI'd like to suggest that this mechanism be considered here for SXG certificates. In order to serve an SXG from a cache, the certificate would need to have that cache's domain in its set of \"Required Domains\". This would drastically reduce the capabilities of an attacker who steals an SXG cert key, mints SXGs and serves them from an arbitrary phishing domain."

    "body": "This PR makes some quality of life improvements for the dump-signedexchange tool\r\n\r\n- Adds support for reading a signed exchange from an HTTPS endpoint rather than from the file system. This feels much more natural to use and allows for faster debugging.\r\n- Allows for more granular control over the output. Generally when I dump a signed exchange, I don't want to see the entire HTML, I'm interested in the signature and the headers.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n- The tool will also warn the user if -i or -uri is not passed instead of simply hanging indefinitely\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\n- Allows the version to be specified with the `-version` flag which defaults to the latest version\r\n- Allows a header such as `AMP-Cache-Transform: google;v=1` to be sent along with the `-uri` request with the `-requestHeader` flag\r\n- Fixes a few instances of `singedexchange` and makes them `signedexchange`\r\n\r\nEDIT 3:\r\n- Added info about json flag to README\r\n- Allows more than one header to be passed with -requestHeader flag\r\n- Mime type factored to version.go\r\n- Input flags take precedence over pipe"

    "body": "While working on the security architecture for Drupal's planned auto-update features, I realized that many of our use cases could be solvable using SXG rather than rolling our own signing mechanism (as APT and Yum have) to support offline signatures for metadata from update servers. We already intend to distribute the metadata via a CDN that has appropriate certificates for drupal.org, but we also don't want the attack surface introduced by every POP being a potential point of compromise. Given that we control the client side in these scenarios, SXG represents one brightly lit path to trusting the metadata without relying solely on TLS or using baroque integrations with GnuPG."

    "body": "Hi! John Wilander from Apple's WebKit team here.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned with the privacy implications of User A and user B not getting the same package when they load the same webpage, or to put it another way, **personalized signed packages with cross-site tracking built in.**\r\n\r\n## Threat Model\r\n\r\n### The Actors\r\n\r\n* **The user.** This is the human who relies on the user agent to protect their privacy.\r\n* **The user agent.** This is the web browser that tries to protect the user's privacy.\r\n* **AdTech or adtech.example.** This is a website that the user engages with as first-party site and that has a financial interest in 1) knowing what the user does on other websites to augment its rich profile of the user and 2) individual targeting of ads, based on its rich profile of the user.\r\n* **News or news.example.** This is a news website which wants its articles to be served as signed packages with the user agent's URL bar showing news.example.\r\n\r\n### The Threat\r\n\r\n1. The user does not want AdTech to be able to augment its profile of them while reading articles on news.example.\r\n2. The user does not want AdTech's rich profile of them to influence the content of ads or articles on news.example.\r\n\r\n### The Attack\r\n\r\nThis is how AdTech could foil the user agent's privacy protections with the current signed packages proposal:\r\n\r\nNews wants to take part in signed package loading but thinks the actual packaging is cumbersome and costly in terms of engineering resources.\r\n\r\nAdTech has a financial incentive to help News get going with signed packages because the technology makes AdTech's services better. Because of this incentive, AdTech decides to offer News a more convenient way to do the packaging; it offers to pull unsigned articles directly from News's servers and do packaging for them. News just has to set up a signing service that AdTech can call to get signatures back, or just hand a signing key straight to AdTech. News sees the opportunity to reduce cost and takes the offer.\r\n\r\nAdTech also has a financial incentive to identify the user on news.example to augment its profile of the user and to earn extra money by serving the user individually targeted ads, but it can't do so because the user's user agent is protecting the user's privacy. However, the request to get a signed News package is actually made to adtech.example, containing the user's AdTech cookies. To achieve their goals and earn more money, AdTech's decides to create news.example packages on the fly, bake in individually targeted ads plus an AdTech user ID for profile enrichment, and sign the whole thing with News's key.\r\n\r\nThis is a case of cross-site tracking. The user is on a news.example webpage, convinced that their user agent protects them from AdTech tracking them on this site, but instead they got a signed package with tracking built in.\r\n\r\n### How the Attack Relates To Other Means of Cross-Site Tracking\r\n\r\nOften when we criticize new, technically distinct tracking vectors, we are told that “you can track users in so many ways so why care about this one?” In the case of signed packages we hear about means of tracking such as doctored links where cross-site tracking is built into the URL, or server-side exchanges of personally identifiable information such as users' email addresses.\r\n\r\nFirst, we don't think past mistakes and flaws in web technologies is a valid argument for why new web technologies should enable cross-site tracking.\r\n\r\nSecond, WebKit is working hard to prevent cross-site tracking, including new limits and restrictions on old technologies. Piling on more such work is not acceptable to us.\r\n\r\nFinally, the success of new web technologies such as signed packages relies on better security and privacy guarantees than what we've had in the past. We want progression in this space, not the status quo.\r\n\r\n## Potential Mitigations and Fixes\r\n\r\nA mitigation we'd like to discuss is this:\r\n\r\n1. The server responding with the signed package is required to send the signature up front. This is to incentivize AdTech to not sign other websites' packages on the fly.\r\n2. The user agent makes an ephemeral, cookie-less preflight request to news.example to get the signature and then validates the package from adtech.example against that signature.\r\n3. We add a signed time stamp to the package signature to avoid AdTech telling News to get signatures from adtech.example backend and send personalized signatures back as preflight responses. With such time stamps, the user agent can decide to not accept signatures younger than, say one minute. For this to work we need signed, official time.\r\n\r\nThe above scheme would make it significantly harder to “personalize” packages.\r\n\r\nAnother potential mitigation would be some kind of public repository of signatures to check against.\r\n"

    "body": "I read this in the specification:\r\n\"Clients MUST NOT accept certificates with this extension in TLS connections (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC8446]).\"\r\n\r\nI don't see any specific reason for this. I would suggest removing this completely from specification, and allowing content to be signed with the same certificate as for TLS connections. (provided the certificate is allowed for signed exchanges)\r\n\r\nSince a signed exchange have a very specific format, I don't see any risk with for example an site-wide XSS becoming a signing oracle for signing exchanges, unless the administrator explicitly configures the page/server in that way for some specific application. (for example a timestamping service allowing signing of arbitary data which is then time-stamped)\r\n\r\nAnother way to improve on this, is to have a special magic value for the extension, that will allow dual usage, so if the extension, instead of having the null value ( 05 00 ), have the exact octet-binary value \"BOTH\" ( 04 42 4f 54 48 ), it will allow dual usage of the certificate.\r\n\r\nThus specification could be instead:\r\n\"A conforming CA MUST NOT issue certificates with this extension unless, for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued:\r\nAn “issue” or “issuewild” CAA property ([RFC6844]) exists that authorizes the CA to issue the certificate; and\r\nThe “cansignhttpexchanges” parameter (Section 4.2.1) is present on the property and is equal to “yes” or \"both\".\r\nA conforming CA MUST NOT issue certificates with this extension set to \"BOTH\", unless \"cansignhttpexchanges\" is equal to \"both\".\r\n\r\nClients MUST NOT accept certificates with this extension in TLS connections, unless the extension has the exact octet-binary value BOTH ( 04 42 4f 54 48 ) (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC8446]).\"\r\n\r\nFor this, the cansignhttpexchanges CAA value must also be extended with a \"both\" option to allow certificates to be issued with the BOTH extension value. (if \"yes\", it will only allow NULL, but if \"both\", it will alllow both NULL and BOTH values)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI also read this:\r\n\"TLS server certificates must be accessible from online servers, so they’re easier to steal or use as signing oracles than an offline key. An exchange’s signing key doesn’t need to be online.\"\r\n and this:\r\n\"Using an exchange-signing key in a TLS (or other directly-internet-facing) server increases the risk that an attacker can steal the private key, which will allow them to mint packages (similar to Section 6.4) until their theft is discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very untrue, as most content-signing servers will of course be directly internet-facing. A majority of server operators will just configure their servers to sign static content when requested, or possibly with a client whitelist (like cloudflares IPs) to prevent it from signing content for others.\r\nThus their CanSignHttpExchanges certificate will in most cases, reside side-with-side with their TLS certificate in the same folder on the same machine.\r\n\r\nOnly more sensitive and advanced companies will make content-signing servers airgapped.\r\n\r\nThe only way to enforce secure usage of such a certificate and make sure its \"airgapped\", is to require it to be loaded on a secure element with presence validation. This is a requirement imposed by most CA's for sub-CA certificates.\r\n\r\nThe only risk I see with completely dropping the restriction, is that a stolen content-signing certificate could be used to host a TLS server used for example phishing attacks and such.\r\n\r\nThats why it might be good to instead use the proposed NULL and BOTH values, so theres 3 types of certificates:\r\n1: Certificates ONLY valid for TLS connections.\r\n2: Certificates valid for BOTH.\r\n3: Certificates ONLY valid for Signed-exchanges.\r\n\r\nthus a server operator is able to choose the security level that fits them best."

Calling `fetch(request)` calls `new Request(request)` internally, so https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-request will need to be modified to preserve the stashed exchange.\r\n\r\nhttps://wicg.github.io/webpackage/loading.html#mp-http-fetch - I think these steps will be invoked twice if there's a service worker in the middle.\r\n\r\n1. Resource requested.\r\n1. Ask service worker for response.\r\n    1. Service worker calls `fetch(event.request)`.\r\n    1. Response is an SXG, so the steps in https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/loading.html#mp-http-fetch happen.\r\n    1.

Right now it looks like a fetch to an SXG would create and follow the redirect, and I'd get the other-origin response rather than the SXG itself. Should the processing of SXG responses be limited to navigations?\r\n\r\n> If response is null and httpRequest’s initiator is \"prefetch\" or \"preload\", return a network error.\r\n\r\nIs it odd that this happens with \"prefetch\" and \"preload\" only? Should it happen with `fetch('whatever.sxg')` too?"

    "body": "Reflecting on [H2 push is tougher than I thought](https://jakearchibald.com/2017/h2-push-tougher-than-i-thought/), there's still one common use case: a set of JS binaries are always downloaded together. This would typically be due to breaking down a big binary into smaller ones where:\r\n 1. The first binary is critical for immediate execution.\r\n 2. All other binaries could be delayed. But ideally not turned into a download waterfall.\r\n 3. Otherwise, the \"other\" binaries are never used by themselves, without the first binary.\r\n\r\nThis is one case, where H2 push would be useful and Web Packages could make this a much simpler and more predictable.\r\n\r\nTo further explain this, consider one big binary that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// First critical block of JS.\r\n(function() {\r\n  global.doLater = function() {...};\r\n  // E.g. 20K of JS code.\r\n})();\r\n\r\n// Second non-critical block of JS.\r\ndoLater(function() {\r\n  // E.g. 40K of JS code.\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Third non-critical block of JS.\r\ndoLater(function() {\r\n  // E.g. 60K of JS code.\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kind of delivery could still save lots of CPU by not immediately executing block 2 and 3, but the main negative is that the overall binary is bigger and has to be fully parsed/compiled before anything can be executed, thus delaying execution of the critical block 1. While some engines are capable of lazy compiling some of the non-critical blocks, the full download/parse is still necessary.\r\n\r\nWeb Packages could help this case by splitting a big binary into smaller files and executing the smaller critical blocks as soon as they are downloaded/parsed.\r\n\r\n/cc @cramforce "

I'm wondering whether some alternatives were considered and rejected.\r\n\r\n> If navigationPreload is enabled, the signed response will be available in the FetchEvent's preloadResponse. Note that this will also cause a network request for requests that aren’t served from a signed exchange.\r\n\r\nI think this makes sense. My understanding is that if the request were to go to \"network\" (i.e., the service worker doesn't call respondWith()), the response would come from the signed exchange, so `preloadResponse` should be that response.\r\n\r\n> clone() the request and set its cache to \"only-if-cached\", to retrieve the matching response from either the signed exchange or the HTTP cache. Note that fetch()ing a new Request with the same url will not retrieve the response from the signed exchange.\r\n\r\nThis I'm not sure about. Historically `respondWIth(fetch(event.request))` is expected to have the same behavior as not calling `respondWith()`. Is it possible to arrange things such that fetch(event.request) gets the response from the signed exchange by default and you need to clone() request and set a flag to skip the signed exchange?"

The key question has come up in many conversations, but I wanted to get it in GitHub. Certain types of publications, such as books, hope to live forever. Users expect to be able to access the content whether or not the publisher still exists. Moby-Dick was published 61,126 days ago, which is somewhat longer than the 7 days that signatures are valid. \r\n\r\nWhat options might publishers have? What happens if we create a bundle of unsigned exchanges? Much of our content would use JS only for a service worker. How does that impact the security issues?\r\n\r\n"

(And, AFAICT, it's also a lower bound via [signature validity](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl.html#signature-validity) step 9.)\r\n\r\n2. Should the draft spec place any limits or suggestion on inner content-encoding? I don't suppose it could specify an allowed list of content encodings because that would preclude future integrity specs. But perhaps it could ban br, deflate, and gzip (unless there's a good reason to specify those on inner rather than outer). Perhaps it could mandate a maximum of one, but maybe that would preclude some future `Digest` header that requires nested encodings."

Liveness check could also piggy back on such a request."

What's the longest certificate lifetime where folks would be comfortable dropping our requirement for OCSP stapling?\r\n* A very-short lifetime will be a problem if a CA has to temporarily disable issuance, for example after security weaknesses in certain domain validation methods are discovered. \r\n* Even a 90-day limit probably requires automated certificate rotation, a'la ACME. Shorter certainly does.\r\n* Should we say anything about re-using an old public key in a new certificate?\r\n\r\nThese requirements may well wind up in the [BRs](https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/) instead of this repository's specs, but this issue will track getting them where they need to go."

    "body": "Related to https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/issues/324\r\n\r\nWhile talking to @bratell-at-opera about signed exchanges, he raised concerns about invalid content continuing to circulate after its publisher realized it is invalid.\r\n\r\nThinking about that problem, it's very similar to the one for which CDNs offer purge mechanisms:\r\n* Articles may include typos, embarrassing mistakes or even false information that can expose the publisher from a legal perspective. Once that is discovered, publishers are likely to want to take down that content immediately.\r\n* E-commerce sites may include pricing mistakes, which they typically want to correct ASAP, as that content can cause them to lose money.\r\n* Court order compliance may also be a reason a content's publisher may want it to no longer be considered valid.\r\n\r\nTalking to @jyasskin, the `validityUrl` can be used in order to verify that the content is still valid from the publisher's perspective. Although it was meant for intermediaries, we can use the same value for browser-side validation, to make sure the browser doesn't display invalid content. \r\n\r\nThe browser would fetch the validity information when navigating to an SXG page. (assuming the browser is online)\r\nIf the SXG content is invalid, the browser would force its reload. Assuming that caches validate content regularly, very few users would actually witness those reloads, in the already rare case that content needed to be purged.\r\n\r\nThis won't solve purge for offline access, but that's similar to any offline content (e.g. in a PWA or a native app)\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

The response payload may be already fully consumed by the client.\r\n- The UA may track the expected C-L while running mice streaming encoder to:\r\n  - emit error if the mice stream payload exceeded the expected C-L\r\n  - emit error on the last chunk if the payload stream length doesn't match the expected C-L.\r\n\r\nI think we have at least the following options:\r\n- Option A: Implement the complex check.\r\n  - Chromium may need this anyway if we add support for mice decoder in for non-SXG raw HTTP.\r\n- Option B: Remove \"is complete\" check and replace it with plain 206 check.\r\n  - This was @kinu's preference in #326.\r\n- Option B': Check 206 && if Content-Length is formatted correctly (\"the response has valid message framing\")\r\n  - Not sure how much this is worth doing.\r\n\r\n@jyasskin, @irori, @kinu : Your thoughts welcome.\r\n"

(That is, from the point of view of the browser, no network access will occur--the already-available response will be returned to the SW.)\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to know:\r\n\r\n- Whether the various mechanisms that currently allow the SW to avoid the various browser caches (e.g. [cache = \"no-store\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache)) will be respected. (If not, this introduces an awkward difference in behavior.)\r\n- Whether the response stream attached to the redirect will also be available via the [navigation.preload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigationPreloadManager) mechanism. (Also, was making the response available via this mechanism only considered? It seems a bit more compatible with what's actually going on, especially with respect to the time at which things occur.)\r\n\r\n/cc @jakearchibald @twifkak "

User Agents (UAs) can trust the signed contents as if the contents are served from the publisher’s origins even if they are served from other distributors’ origins. The signed contents can be served from any distributors’ origins. But if the publisher wants to serve subresources such as scripts and images from the distributors’ origin, the publisher needs to change the subresource URLs in the HTML to point to each distributors’ URL and need to sign for each distributor. The proposed two fields can solve this problem.\r\n\r\n**Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources map:**\r\nA map from the original subresource requests to the SXG URLs. This field is not signed. So the distributor can change this field to point to their URLs.\r\n\r\n**Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources list:**\r\nThe subresource URL list which can be served using SXG instead of fetching the original URL. This field is signed by the publisher. So the distributor can’t change this field.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n**Publisher:** https://publisher.example/article_1.html\r\n```\r\n  <script src=\"framework.js\"></script>\r\n  <img src=\"article_1.jpg>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SXG in Publisher:** https://publisher.example/article_1.html.sxg\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  // URL\r\n  'https://publisher.example/article_1.html',\r\n  // Signature\r\n  'sig1: sig=*...; integrity=\"digest/mi-sha256\";cert-url=\"https://publisher.example/cert\"',\r\n  // [New field] Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources\r\n  // The key of the mapping may need Accept headers info in order to enable content\r\n  // negotiation (e.g. for WebP).\r\n  [\r\n    [{':url': 'https://publisher.example/framework.js', 'accept': '*/*'},\r\n     'https://publisher.example/framework.js.sxg'],\r\n    [{':url': 'https://publisher.example/article_1.jpg', 'accept': '*/*'},\r\n     'https://publisher.example/article_1.jpg.sxg']\r\n  ],\r\n  // Signed headers\r\n  [\r\n    { ':method': 'GET', 'accept': '*/*' },\r\n    {\r\n      ':status': '200',\r\n      // [New field]\r\n      ':allowed-alternative-signed-exchange-subresources':\r\n          '\"https://publisher.example/framework.js\",'\r\n          '\"https://publisher.example/article_1.jpg\"',\r\n      'content-encoding': 'mi-sha256-03',\r\n      'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',\r\n      'digest': 'mi-sha256-03=....'\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  // Payload body\r\n  '<html><body>...'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SXG in Distributor:** https://distributor.example/article_1.html.sxg\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  // URL\r\n  'https://publisher.example/article_1.html',\r\n  // Signature\r\n  'sig1: sig=*...; integrity=\"digest/mi-sha256\";cert-url=\"https://distributor.example/publisher.example/cert\"',\r\n  // [New field] Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources\r\n  [\r\n    [{':url': 'https://publisher.example/framework.js', 'accept': '*/*'},\r\n     'https://distributor.example/publisher.example/framework.js.sxg'],\r\n    [{':url': 'https://publisher.example/article_1.jpg', 'accept': '*/*'},\r\n     'https://distributor.example/publisher.example/article_1.jpg.sxg']\r\n  ],\r\n  // Signed headers (Same as the SXG in Publisher)\r\n  [\r\n    { ':method': 'GET', 'accept': '*/*' },\r\n    {\r\n      ':status': '200',\r\n      // [New field]\r\n      ':allowed-alternative-signed-exchange-subresources':\r\n          '\"https://publisher.example/framework.js\",'\r\n          '\"https://publisher.example/article_1.jpg\"',\r\n      'content-encoding': 'mi-sha256-03',\r\n      'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',\r\n      'digest': 'mi-sha256-03=....'\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  // Payload body (Same as the SXG in Publisher)\r\n  '<html><body>...'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How UAs should work\r\n- When the user opens the SXG in the distributor, the UA must check the signature using the certificate in https://distributor.example/publisher.example/cert. (This is the existing behavior)\r\n- The UA processes the script tag and the img tag and decides to fetch the \"framework.js\" and the image \"article_1_small.jpg\".\r\n- Instead of fetching the original URL in publisher.example, UA should fetch the SXG files in distributor.example after checking the `Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field and the `Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field.\r\n- If the original URL is not in the `Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field, the UA must fetch the original URL. This is intended to avoid the subresource monitoring attack.\r\n- If the original URL’s origin is not same as the signed origin of the main SXG (publisher.example), the UA must fetch the original URL. This restriction is intended to avoid providing a way of tracking.\r\n- UAs should handle the preload link header in the signed response header in the same way. (ex: `link: <https://example.com/framework.js>;rel=\"preload\";as=\"script\"`)\r\n\r\n## Subresource monitoring attack\r\nWe need the signed `Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` to avoid the subresource monitoring attack like this:\r\n- A publisher generates a SXG of a html which shows the user's icon using JS. `icon.src = USER_ID + '.png';`\r\n- An attacker sets the mapping info like this: `{ 'example.com/a.png': 'attacker.com/a.png.sxg', 'example.com/b.png': 'attacker.com/b.png.sxg', ....}`\r\n- If UA fetches the SXG of png when the image tag is added, the attacker can know the USER_ID. Even if UA only uses the prefetched SXG, the attacker distributor can intentionally delay returning the SXGs one by one to see when the load actually finishes by monitoring the onload event, therefore can know the USER_ID.\r\n\r\n## Tracking using subresource SXG\r\nWe need to prohibit the SXG loading for cross-origin subresources to avoid the user tracking like this:\r\n- A publisher sets one subresource to the `Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field (https://tracking.example/id.js)\r\n- The distributor server can let the publishers’ site know about the user’s ID (ABCD1234) by changing the `Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field.\r\n - tracking.example/id.js points to tracking.example/ABCD1234.sxg (body is `const id='ABCD1234';)\r\n\r\nTracking is still possible even if we prohibit cross-origin subresources using the following logic. But this is more difficult.\r\n- A publisher sets 30 subresources to the `Allowed-Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field (https://publisher.example/00, 01, ... 29)\r\n- The publisher prepares 60 files, 00_0.sxg (body is 0), 00_1.sxg (body is 1),  01_0.sxg (body is 0), 01_1.sxg (body is 1)...\r\n- The distributor server can let the publishers’ site know about the user’s ID in binary digits by changing the `Alternative-Signed-Exchange-Subresources` field.\r\n  - publisher.example/00 points to 00_0.sxg or 00_1.sxg\r\n  - publisher.example/01 points to 01_0.sxg or 01_1.sxg\r\n  - ....\r\n- This logic provides a way of user tracking of 2^30 users.\r\n"

    "body": "When a server returns a web package in the application/signed-exchange format, it'll embed the request URL in the returned binary blob in the fallbackUrl field. Depending on the server implementation, the encoding of bytes of the URL might vary. Some implementation might choose the easiest solution, which is to just reflect whatever representation the client sends.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, because this gives attackers an easy injection point within the first few bytes of the file, which can be turned into code running in the victim origin using content sniffing. The Adobe PDF parser for example ignores the unknown prefix bytes if it finds a valid PDF signature within the first 1kb of the file.\r\n\r\nThe \"x-content-type-options: nosniff\" header instruct browsers to not do content sniffing, but plugins can choose to (and in many cases do) ignore them. Because of this, the usual suggestion is to host partially user controlled binary files only on sandbox domains (when it's not possible to sufficiently escape the user controlled parts, which is usually not the case).\r\n\r\nThis demo page is not vulnerable to this, because it requires a special Accept request header: https://azei-package-test.com/ Clients that can't interpret the web package format will never send this header, so they'll never see the signed exchange file format.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to use some kind of encoding for all reflected values (e.g. base64) to avoid introducing a valuable injection point in the first place."

Perhaps the fetch spec should say how browsers should respond if the fallbackUrl is too long, or alternatively specify a minimum length they must support. Otherwise, browsers may behave differently (e.g. network error, redirect to fallback URL, or display a trimmed URL). Or is this already covered by some other part of Fetch?"

    "body": "## I wish signed exchanges to cover the non-repudiation use-case\r\n\r\nI wish to use the `Signature` header for non repudiation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n  - client sends a request with a Signature of given headers and payload\r\n  - server replies with a Signature that may contain e.g. the request hash\r\n\r\n### Non repudiation\r\nSee [nist 800-32](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-32/final)\r\n\r\nAssurance that:\r\n\r\n  - the sender is provided with proof of delivery \r\n  - and that the recipient is provided with proof of the sender's identity \r\n\r\nso that neither can later deny having processed the data.\r\n\r\nTechnical non repudiation refers to the assurance a Relying Party has that if a public key is used to validate a digital signature, that signature had to have been made by the corresponding private signature key. \r\n\r\nLegal non-repudiation refers to how well possession or control of the private signature key can be established. \r\n\r\n### Elements for non repudiation\r\n\r\nNon repudiation via PKI is usually achieved adding\r\n\r\n1- in a request\r\n\r\n  - an hash of the request representation\r\n  - a signature of the above hash and further elements, eg: `issuer, audience, subject, issued_at, not_before, expires`, similar to JWS claims\r\n  - sender informations\r\n\r\n2- in a response\r\n\r\n  - an hash of the response representation\r\n  - a signature of the above hash and further elements, including an hash of the original request\r\n  - original request informations (eg. the hash) may be added in the response representation\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther informations may include:\r\n\r\n  - URL or content of the certificate to be used for validating the signature\r\n\r\n### Signature and Non Repudiation\r\n\r\nThere are various similarities b/w the informations contained in this spec and Non Repudiation.\r\n\r\n  - `Digest` can be used to guarantee the integrity of the representation (eg. with other values of Content-Encoding)\r\n  - `Signature` covers a list of `Signed-Headers` which may cover all necessary headers\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nAn example of non-repudiation via HTTP Headers is defined in:\r\n\r\n-  [Berlin Group Financial API §11](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c2914b_5351b289bf844c6881e46ee3561d95bb.pdf) based on [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-10](draft-cavage-http-signatures-10)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions from #88 \r\n\r\nAbout https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/pull/88#discussion_r152628889\r\n\r\n  - agree JWS security issues though not everybody agrees on deprecating JOSE [see those tweets on jose vs paseto]( https://twitter.com/ioggstream/status/972126134136647687)\r\n\r\n  -  support for different curves and rsa is useful: is `CSP-style` eg `key=ed25519-base64` that dangerous, considering that we should somewhat converge in some way? Clearly RSA would be insanely longer\r\n\r\n  - about algos, in your opinion will ed25519 replace all the other algos in the near future so that we should \"hardcode\" its name? Should we \"deprecate\" RSA signatures?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Chromium would like to be able to ship these formats and then continue evolving them as they make their way through the standards process. QUIC attempts something like this by defining [\"invariants\"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-invariants-01), \"properties of the QUIC transport protocol that are expected to remain unchanged over time as new versions of the protocol are developed.\" To try the same thing in these specifications, it might make sense to put a fallback URL in a fixed place in both the signed exchange and bundles formats.\r\n\r\nFor signed exchanges, this would be the request URL that's currently encoded as the `:url` field in the [request headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses-04#section-3.2). For bundles, it would be the [`start_url`](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#start_url-member) that's expected to be in the bundle's [manifest](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges-00#section-3.2.2). In both cases, the value would be moved instead of copied to the new location, to avoid the possibility of inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nWhen the client receives an unknown version of the format (either too old or too new), it would redirect to the fallback URL. Offline users would be out of luck, but online ones would still be able to get the content.\r\n\r\nThis could also be accomplished using content negotiation on the `Accept` header, but that's a [joint that might rust shut](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html), so we should try to make things work even if it's rusty, if possible.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    "body": "# Goal\r\n- Easier streaming consumption of large bundles.\r\n- Easier non-streaming consumption of the small bundles.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nIn the current bundle spec, the structure of the responses section is allowed to be very flexible and not required to be a CBOR construct.\r\n\r\n## Streaming loading algorithm for current format\r\nWhen loading a bundle in a streamed fashion, currently the parser will:\r\n1. Consume the index section\r\n1. Sort the exchanges by their response range offset\r\n1. Consume the other sections up till the responses section\r\n1. Discard the bytes until it reaches the first exchange in the sorted list\r\n1. Buffer the bytes until it reaches the end of the the first exchange\r\n1. The first exchange becomes ready for its use:\r\n  1. Parse its responses header CBOR map\r\n  1. Read its payload\r\n1. Append bytes to the buffer until it reaches the end of the next item.\r\n1. The second exchange becomes ready for its use.\r\n1. ...\r\n\r\nSince there may be overlap in the response exchange, we need to keep around the original responses section in the buffer (which probably will reside on memory), since they may theoretically be used more than 1 time in a different CBOR interpretation. It is non-trivial to compute the \"done\" part of the responses section which are not referenced in later exchanges to partially free the original responses bytes buffer.\r\n\r\n## Non-streaming consumption of the small bundles\r\nIf the entire bundle is guaranteed to be a valid CBOR, it will become very easy to consume small packages which will easily fit in memory. If efficiency is not an issue, you can feed the entire package to CBOR parser, and consume the exchanges without implementing the full parsing algorithm.\r\n\r\nFor example, @irori created [a live web demo of unbundler](\r\nhttps://bundle-load-test.surge.sh/) which assumes that the bundler output a CBOR array as response section.\r\n\r\n# Proposals\r\n- Specify the structure of the responses section\r\n  - A valid CBOR array? \r\n- An index section entry references the response via array index, not offset\r\n  - Enforces the start of the response is aligned to the start of the item in the responses CBOR array\r\n  - Can save an alignment assert in the parser\r\n- Require the responses section to be always after the index section"

    "body": "I suppose the latest draft of the -impl checkpoint basically follows the latest responses draft ('the main draft) with some gaps, so a typical workflow could be like to keep cherry-picking changes from the latest responses into the latest impl draft.  However there are some diffs that are only tracked by the impl checkpoint but not in the main draft, e.g. like https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/pull/155 (`MI` vs `MI-draft2`).  I can see the reason not to track this in the main draft, but I'm afraid tracking such changes that only exist in some branch but not in the master responses draft may become a bit cumbersome, especially if we start to have multiple of such diffs.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to avoid doing this but instead put some instructions for the implementors in the main draft? (This is something @jyasskin mentioned as a potential alternative in some of our offline chat)  Or could we have some special section in the ChangeLog in the main draft so that all we need to cherry-pick can be still found in the main draft?"

To workaround this, Chromium has an [internal testing API](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/991833) (available only in test runner) that overrides signature verification time.\r\n\r\nIn order to test Signed Exchange Loading in web-platform-tests, we need an interoperable way to override signature verification time. The preferred way is defining a [WebDriver extension](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-extension-command) in the respective spec (in this case, Signed Exchange) so that the same surface API is used across UAs.\r\n\r\nSee [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlFRcKuTM3RpoYjcOtiVOioRErEkJyCyv8hDs9_mlXo/edit#heading=h.n0pzm6uk5f69) for more details and discussions."

Additionally, there may be other use cases where \"internal only\" package contents might be needed and beneficial.\r\n\r\nIf that seems out of scope for this sort of bundling, though, no worries. Just wanted to check. 😃 \r\n\r\nWe'll be exploring that need in the Publishing WG via https://github.com/w3c/pwpub/issues/24\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n🎩 "

The first use needs to be similar to [`<link rel=preload>`](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#link-type-preload) so that it's not revalidated during that first use.\r\n1.

(In particular, to withhold new content, and present old content as if it were fresh.)\r\n\r\nWith current browsers, when a user clicks on a link, if a page subsequently loads and `https://news.example.com/` is shown in the URL bar, they can be confident that the browser is displaying content retrieved from `news.example.com` and that was retrieved *after* they clicked on the link.  (That is, the content is fresh.) However, this is not necessarily true if the resource in question is a signed webpackage delivered by a CDN: whilst the content was signed by `news.example.com`, it could be up to 7 days old.\r\n\r\nThis may result in unexpected behavior for users in regions where the use of such CDNs/caches is pervasive (for e.g. performance and/or regulatory reasons) and where the cache operator has the ability and desire to selectively censor information (perhaps in reaction to a particular event or crisis). \r\n\r\nIf the cache rewrites links, it may even be possible to arrange for an entire website to appear up to date and completely functional when in fact fresh content is mixed with old at the discretion of the intermediary.\r\n\r\nSome mechanisms that may help reduce these risks:\r\n\r\n- Clients could indicate to users that content was not retrieved from an intermediary, and not the origin, and recommend that the \"reload\" feature be used if users are unsure of its freshness. (This also requires that the reload feature applies to the user-visible URL, and not the network URL; is this a recommendation of the format?)\r\n- Clients could verify the `validityUrl` more frequently than required, or allow users to manually trigger a validity check. (Related to [6.3 Downgrades](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html#rfc.section.6.3).)\r\n- Recommend that origins who believe they might be subject to such attacks expire signatures within seconds or minutes. (Perhaps this could vary per cache, depending on the degree of confidence the origin has in the cache.)\r\n- Recommend that origins embed absolute timestamps within their content (e.g. \"Last modified: 2018-03-15 18:45\"), so that users are aware when content is not fresh."

This isn't extensible if we ever want to add new non-signed values, so I added a format version number into the format's magic number.\r\n\r\n[Preview](https://jyasskin.github.io/webpackage/no-streaming/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html), [Diff](https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.txt&url2=https://jyasskin.github.io/webpackage/no-streaming/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.txt)\r\n\r\nFixes #135."

    "body": "For DoS reasons, the low-level portions of the networking stack must never buffer memory unboundedly. That means the Digest option is not usable, unless we move the hash check to the higher-level portions, but integrity is handled in the low-level portions. This means the low-level portions must return data with a \"this is unchecked, please check it later\". This is a classic mistake in designing a crypto system. All in all, this means that it is unlikely that any implementation of Digest could pass muster in Chrome.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding random redundant options is generally a bad idea. There's no reason to offer Digest when MI suffices. Please remove Digest from the specification completely."

    "body": "@davidben points out that it's hard to write streaming parsers, and that the most reliable protocols send a number of bytes to read, read that number of bytes, and then use a non-streaming parser to pull information out of that contiguous data. The format in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses-03#section-5.3 doesn't accomplish this because CBOR items are prefixed by their length in items, not bytes.\r\n\r\nIn multi-process clients, we also want to allow the main/verification process to bound the amount of memory it uses. This implies (1) a length limit on the exchange header set, and (2) mandating use of the MI header instead of the Digest header to verify the payload authenticity, since MI has fixed-size records.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be nice to be able to check signatures against the literal bytes in the http-exchange format instead of needing to reserialize. Reserialization still needs to be *possible* so that intermediates can receive a signature in a normal same-origin HTTP response and then produce the http-exchange format, but final clients shouldn't need to do it.\r\n\r\nThis probably means the format will move away from being a general http-exchange serialization format and toward being specific to signed exchanges. This has the extra benefit of not needing to say that request payloads and response trailers cause the signature not to verify."

I suspect all RSA keys in the wild use the rsaEncryption OID, so banning that (to avoid Bleichenbacher attacks) would be equivalent to banning RSA keys, but if not, maybe we could allow the RSASSA-PSS ones.\r\n\r\n@sleevi @davidben"

    "body": "As a developer, it would be useful to be able to read what resources are in my own bundle.\r\n\r\nUse case example: I am writing a offline capable Zine webapp. I typically have a directory for each issue, and a number of html files in each directory corresponding to pages in my Zine. There is also a \"zine browser\" main interface that let's me pick which zine I want to read, or skip to pages, and the main interface knows what I was last reading. To let people share my zine, I create a webpackage of the client software, and a number of zine issues.\r\n\r\nDilemma: how does my main interface know what zines are available in the bundle?\r\n\r\nIdeally, as a developer, I could have the main-client reader able to ask- what resources do I already know about? Any zines in a webpackage ought to be able to present themselves to my main client, let it know: hey, there's content here.\r\n\r\nThis issue gets more pointed if users start collecting multiple webpackages, like if I release a new webpackage with new zines. Before- considering the case of only a single webpackage of main-client+zines- it would perhaps not be pleasant but it could be possible to build an index file into my webpackage that enumerates all the content. However when there are multiple webpackages available, it becomes outright impossible to work with this situation. The main-client will not have a way to figure out what is in other bundles.\r\n\r\nAn implementation of #107 would resolve this use case. If webpackage content were available via the page's Cache APIs then we could use `Cache.keys()` to discover the content.\r\n\r\nThere is a related problem in HTTP/2 PUSH, with not being able to detect content: whatwg/fetch#65. As a page, there's no way to detect resources that HTTP/2 PUSH has sent: once again the developer needs to create an out-of-band mechanism to ever be able to access the resource.\r\n\r\nI would like to see listing of at least same-origin content added to the use-cases. I hope this example of a Zine illustrates the need and how this capability would help. Thanks."

[Web Packaging Format’s use-cases note has a “Packaged Web Publications”][] in its “Nice-to-have” section; it refers to the Publishing WG and discusses several abstract use cases provided by the WG, without actual reference to WPub as a specification. Several issues here (#3 “Relationship to DPUB”, #32 “Document Adobe’s use cases”, #37 “Add a list of goals and non-goals”, #71 “Start an internet-draft”) also refer to the Publishing WG. Some Publishing WG members (@lrosenthol, @iherman, @dauwhe)  have participated in these issues.\r\n\r\nNone of these references talk about WPub as a separate specification, and none of them elaborate on its relationship with Web Packaging Format. Neither the [Web Packaging specification itself][] nor the [obsolete TAG Packaging on the Web draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/) make any mention of WPub either.\r\n\r\nThis is triply confusing. There is clear overlap between the two specifications’ use cases. For instance, both initiatives appear to desire addressing Google AMP’s use cases. Even their names are confusingly similar (WPK vs. PWP). Both are being actively developed—there were even announcements regarding both on this same week (the [WPub public-draft announcement][Publishing WG announcement] and the [Google AMP Project’s announcement on its transition to WPK][WPK for Google AMP]). And some of the same people have participated in both discussions on one standard and discussions on the other.\r\n\r\nFor readers of both specifications, it would be useful if their authors clarified this uncertainty. “What is the relationship between the two standards?” “Why are there two separate standards?” “How are their use cases and file formats similar and different?” Further active collaboration between the two specs’ authors might also be worth pursuing. Though it might be too late for unification, it would be a shame if there was fragmentation of the same goal into two formats. Browser vendors are probably less likely to implement two formats than just one. On the other hand, if their use cases are irreconcilable, then that should be made explicit in the specifications.\r\n\r\n(Also cf. https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5#issuecomment-314265230, https://github.com/w3c/wpub/issues/5#issuecomment-315076651 by @HadrienGardeur; as well as w3c/wpub#10, w3c/wpub#90, and w3c/wpub#111.)\r\n\r\n[Publishing WG announcement]: https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6756\r\n\r\n[Packaged Web Publications]: https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-pwpub-20180104\r\n\r\n[Web Packaging Format’s use-cases note has a “Packaged Web Publications”]: https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases.html#rfc.section.2.2.1\r\n\r\n[Web Packaging specification itself]: https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html\r\n\r\n[obsolete TAG Packaging on the Web draft]: https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/\r\n\r\n[WPK for Google AMP]: https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/improving-urls-for-amp-pages/amp/\r\n  "

    "body": "Scenario: Developer A includes a package from Developer B (e.g. a specific version of jQuery, or a hypothetical wasm implementation of python3) to serve the purpose of a shared library. This is loaded from a version-specific URL, say packages.jquery.com/v3-2-1, to ensure that A's app is running with the right version of jQuery or python that it was developed for. However, A has to trust the integrity of B and B's server to actually keep the resource static. B or any attacker on B's server has the power to inject malicious code into A's web app. This makes shared libraries impractical for security-critical applications. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, A links B's package with both a URL and a hash, which is checked by the client as soon as B's package is loaded (libraries are unlikely to need streaming). So A can have absolute confidence that their app uses the exact same version of the resource that it has been developed for, while keeping the benefits of shared library use.\r\n  "

One of these documents was the original packaging on the web which has since been obsoleted by your work. However there are many open issues on our document and before we summarily closed them we wanted to alert you to these issues in case you wanted to bring any of them over into your issues list. Can you please have a look through [these issues](https://github.com/w3ctag/packaging-on-the-web/issues) and leave a note on each issue to let us know that it's OK to close it? If you do take one of them on as an issue, please leave a note including a link to your new issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDan Appelquist\r\nCo-Chair, W3CTAG"

For example, instead of allowing arbitrary `RevocationInfoChoice`s, we might specify that the `SignedData.crls` field be filled with exactly one OCSP response. The result could still be parsed with CMS tools, but it could also be parsed with much simpler package-specific tools.\r\n\r\nI suspect we'll run into some trouble around the `SignerInfo.*algorithm` fields: the current format specifies exactly one digest+signature algorithm for each possible certificate type, and doesn't encode that algorithm into the serialized bytes. CMS appears to allow the attacker to select the algorithms, just like [JOSE](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/). A package-specific parser would enforce the restriction, but a generic CMS tool wouldn't, and so would be vulnerable to the same attacks as JOSE. That's a reason to use a non-CMS format, to disallow generic tools from parsing package signatures."

    "body": "The sketch, which I've run by @sleevi, is:\r\n1. Check the manifest's signature and that the signing certificate is for the package's claimed origin and that it chains to a trusted root, using intermediate certificates included in the package.\r\n2. Each package also has an accompanying set of OCSP responses and anti-downgrade information.\r\n3. The UA checks that the OCSP responses are signed by the certificate's signer and were generated less than 7 days ago.\r\n4. The UA checks that the anti-downgrade information is signed by a certificate trusted for package's origin (potentially taking advantage of the package's intermediate certs), hasn't expired yet and was signed less than 7 days ago, and says that the package's date is sufficiently recent.\r\n5. If any of this isn't recent enough, the package identifies a URL from which to fetch newer validity information. This validity information is small (<1kb?), so it should be cheap enough to fetch even when full packages are too expensive.\r\n\r\nThere's some evidence that we'll still have a significant number of UAs that are fully offline and won't be able to fetch new validity information every week. Depending on the existing HTTP cache's behavior, maybe we don't need to revalidate once we've opened a package once. Maybe it's ok to trust older validations as long as the package doesn't make any network requests, and have revalidation block the package's first network request when the UA gets back online. We'll need to decide what to do about local storage if that validation fails.\r\n\r\nI need to add this to the main explainer."

This is easy for ECDSA and EdDSA keys, but would need work for RSA keys. Straw man: <=3072 bits gets rsa_pss_sha256, and >=3073 gets rsa_pss_sha384.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, like TLS' [ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/#rfc.section.4.2.3) vs JWS' [ES256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.4), even though the algorithm is the same, the signature appears in different formats.\r\n\r\nAny of these options is sufficient to let us sign with any TLS certificate, but TLS doesn't yet have identifiers for post-quantum signature schemes that counter-signatures might want to use.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I received feedback from some of our security people that [DER](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/X.690-0207.pdf) is easier to parse securely than [CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049). I'm not 100% sure that's the right choice yet, so here are some pros and cons.\r\n\r\nDER Pro's:\r\n1. Much older, with security-hardened implementations in many languages. e.g. BoringSSL includes a library for memory-safe DER parsing. CBOR has [many implementations](http://cbor.io/impls.html), but they aren't hardened.\r\n1. Prefixing with the length in bytes makes it easier to skip unneeded items. CBOR can work around this by embedding things into bytestrings.\r\n1. Generic parsing has only 2 cases: Primitive, where the interpretation of the bytes depends on the tag, and Constructed, where the content bytes encode a sequence of items. CBOR has 8 cases: integer, string, array, map, tag, simple value, simple value in next byte, and float. This is primarily used to skip unknown fields in structures.\r\n\r\nCBOR Pro's:\r\n1. ~8 primitive types instead of 30+. We can subset ASN.1 to only use INTEGER, OCTET STRING, UTF8String, and SEQUENCE, but we can also subset CBOR to use integers, byte strings, text strings, arrays, and maps.\r\n1. Extensibility based on maps from strings to values is easier to understand and possibly to manage than ASN.1's extensibility based on appending to sequences. However, it's possible I've missed a better way to extend structures in ASN.1.\r\n1. It's easy to find the latest specification.\r\n1. Combining the length into the type saves a byte for smaller items.\r\n1. Serializing canonical CBOR, which is needed for signature checking, is significantly easier to implement.\r\n1. All DER integers and floats have to deal with the complexity of encoding bignums. For our purposes, where bignums aren't needed, CBOR's 8,16,32, and 64-bit integers are simpler. Even if bignums were needed, it's likely that a fixed length would be simpler to specify and implement than DER's variable-length encoding.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we stick with CBOR, we'll mandate [Canonical CBOR](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-3.9), which includes minimal integer encodings. That means offsets will need to measure a range that doesn't include the offset itself, but that's doable for both the section list and the resource index.\r\n\r\nI'll update this list as more considerations come up."

URLs can be fairly long, so we may want to optimize or compress that redundancy.\r\n\r\nOne idea for avoiding this duplication: Add a section of abbreviations that assigns each resource-key an index, and use those indices as the keys in the other three sections.\r\n\r\n1. We could re-use the index as that section of abbreviations.\r\n2. We probably don't want to re-use the manifest as that section, so that aggregating packages can build their own abbreviations.\r\n3. The abbreviations need to be expanded before hashing or checking signatures.\r\n4. We could shorten the abbreviation section even more by:\r\n   1. Resolving each URL/resource-key relative to the previous one.\r\n   1. Using the array index of the URL as its abbreviation instead of making the section name an abbreviation.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to use a shared brotli dictionary to compress all three sections. The main downside here is that shared brotli dictionaries don't exist yet, and when they do, we may want to use a URL to identify which shared dictionary to use, which we'd again want to compress."

We think it makes sense to switch to 100% binary format since the header compression and parts body compression makes it mostly binary anyways. It also lets us to replace MIME boundary strings with direct chunk-size kind of encoding.\r\n2. The Explainer and samples in it will be gradually updated to reflect switch to binary encoding. While in update, there can be some inconsistency in the doc.\r\n\r\nAlso discussed:\r\n- Binary alignment at 32 bit boundaries (decided not to)\r\n- Use Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (rfc 6256) (decided not to)\r\n- Split content index and offset table (so the resources may be rearranged)\r\n- Multiple hashes (to support deprecation of old ones)\r\n- Cross-signing\r\n"

    "body": "Hi all, I saw some of you at Blink On, and I promised to come up with a few user stories. Rather than trying help shape the implementation, I thought I could just outline why electron is looking at this format. Here's my first pass at some user stories.\r\n\r\n## App Installer Story\r\n\r\nDeveloper Kim builds a new electron app, and wants to host it on her site. She wants to make the install as easy as possible, and a new hot installation tool some people have downloaded knows how to take a web package, and install it like a desktop app. Right now, every electron app comes with its own chromium. A web package format distribution could link out to the required chromium, which may already be installed on the users desktop.\r\n\r\nThe end-user downloads the `.electron` bundle, double-clicks it, and the installer installs a new app.\r\n\r\nBoth the installer, and the operating system should be validating the package and checking code signatures. (Open question if the dynamic installer messes up the signature story)\r\n\r\nA new icon is placed wherever there operating system installs applications, and double-clicking it opens the app.\r\n\r\n## Lifecycle with _shared_ resources\r\n\r\nKim is at it again, but this time her users have demanded an even slimmer after install experience. Kim builds the next web package bundle, but instead of including everything in `node_modules` the web package simply links out to indicate that a requires these and PM modules at specific versions. To complicate matters, some of these modules require compilation.\r\n\r\nKim knows that not all of her users have developer tools installed, but also doesn't want to set up CI on numerous different platforms. That's okay, we have your back. The top 100 electron modules that require compilation have been precompiled on common platforms packaged into a web package format.\r\n\r\nUser Angela downloads Kim's latest web package, which only includes the core app code. The installer understands the outbound links in the web package, and first attempts to satisfy them with a local cache on disk. One of the compiled dependencies is missing however, and the installer has to downloaded fresh. Instead of pulling from npm directly, the installer is able to resolve the location of a precompiled version and use that.\r\n\r\n## BigCorp\r\n\r\nBig Corp once control over every last bit of their installed application. They want to block every last piece down. They want a self-contained packaging format, where everything gets shipped altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is the situation we have now, which is why it's worth putting down.\r\n\r\n## BigCrop Internal\r\n\r\nInternally at big Corp, they have a lot of internal tools developers that wish to distribute quick one-off applications. Because everything is running behind their firewall, they only want vetted code. Developers love the hotlinking that the web package can do, but all links should resolve to an internal npm mirror and an internal blob store for precompiled modules."

These all work by having a directory at end of file, but for all use cases I know a pointer to start of archive on the tail would be sufficient. Doing so would most likely just be a series of magic bytes and kength that exists at the end of the file. It could be optional but must be easy to add to an existing webpackage.\r\n\r\nFor a signature of the entire binary + archive this is important so people don't perform a secondary concatenation and load a different archive than expected, it most likely can just be a well known header that optionally exists on the package headers."
